# adescoin
adescoin is a simple implementation of my custom token that can be used to exchange or store value, and can be transferred.
The adescoin token is non-divisible i.e., it can only be transferred in whole numbers, e.g 1, 2, 3 or 22 tokens but not in fractions like 1.6 tokens.
It has a fixed total supply of 10000 tokens and this cannot be changed.
Anyone can receive the adescoin token.
Anyone with at least one token can transfer some adescoin tokens.
The entire supply is assigned to my address as the deployer of the contract.
